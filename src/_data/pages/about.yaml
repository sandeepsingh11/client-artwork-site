  **G4LLO** (pronounced, Ga-yo like a Spanish rooster Gallo) is a multifaceted
  digital artist, vocalist, and DJ.


  His art is organic, abstract, and intuitive. Resisting the pressure to conform, he relies on his intuition and body to guide his work. G4LLO is against any propaganda or movements that utilizes tools of terrorism such as, toxic shame, violation of human rights, critical over-corrections of the human body and soul, controlling efforts and gaslighting. To do so, he relies on his love for life in its good and bad, avoiding judgment and instead offering radical compassion and empathy.

  Everything about his life has involved chaos, and he has learned to become a
  friend to it. From being a first-generation Guatemalan-American, to learning
  that he has traits of AuDHD, OCD and Bipolar II. Or discovering nuance in his
  trans and queer identities being simultaneously both within the gender binary
  and outside the binary.


  He identifies with Rigoberta Menchu's term, Ladino, being a son of a mixed meztizo lineage within Guatemalan paternal lines, and has Cantonese Spaniard diaspora lineages from his matrilineal inheritances.


  His life started with Jehovah Witness family and he eventually joined the organization in hopes of escaping and praying away his own queerness and transgender identities. Seth has coped and made meaning of domestic violence throughout his childhood through drawing since the age of 2, dedicating his pre-teen and teenage years to music organizations such as band choir and marching bands over the span of 9 years, and eventually minoring in Music at the University of Central Florida.


  Being a son of dedicated fast-food workers, it has become a mission for Seth to give back to those who have fed him, raised him and taught him throughout his life. He cares and advocates for the Caribbean communities of Florida, the Black American community who have given him the words to better find his authentic identities, as well as the Indigenous communities that fight for their rights to live in peace in their own lands.

  This space is for those who've had to overcome days of homelessnes, narcisstic
  abuse, addiction, domestic violence, survive suicidality and self harm,
  overcome un-doing generationally inherited internalized ableism and racism,
  overall chaos and/or trans neo diaspora.


  This site is a reminder to All on the power of self-expression and self definition in a world that obligates many to conform oppressive, reactive structures. Welcome to my synthesis of my life and to the New World order which frees the lives of BIPOC Queer/Trans, and Disabled lives.
