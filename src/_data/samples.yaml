  - title: Queer Power // procreate (2023)

    highlight: yes
    desc: Experimental and abstract to showcaste one of my pieces that I created as
      I learned to identify, embrace and love my queerness. Being queer is
      unmatching, intuitive, abstract, undefined, outside the binary. Queerness
      is a gift from the Universe, which defies the categorization of a human
      soul. Alas, I learned that it is not a crime nor a sin to embody that
      which is Queer.

  - title: Dissonant Love // procreate digital piece (2023)
    image: /images/untitled_artwork-1.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: no
    desc: As I took the time to heal from an abusive relationship, I returned to my
      love for art and captured layers of dissonance yet beauty. Using my
      intuition, Dissonant Love captures the emotions I had felt while piecing
      myself together. While there is dissonance in this world, love is always a
      choice.

    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: yes
    desc: Another experimental, intuitive and abstract piece created to express
      dissonance in this world. Nothing is aligned to the earth so long as she
      is not loved and respected. Instead, society is entirely constructed to
      misalign the body, mind, and soul.

    highlight: no
    desc: Following a car accident, and being gaslight about the cause of the
      incident-- this piece was born. I used my intuition and sense of play to
      express the pain of being lied to by someone I considered a close friend
      of mine. I often have wondered, how many times must I allow the treatment
      of narcissists to affect my soul especially because it's all I've ever
      known. This piece reminds me of the pain that I endured as raw and
      abstract as I could have ever expressed myself.

    title: Ladine Child
    desc: I was once a trans child who did not know who they were. At the time, I
      could not recognize my face, nor my voice. If I could go back, or offer
      future generations, I would not assign myself or any child a gender until
      they themselves are able to identify their own gender.
