  - title: Queer Power // procreate (2023)
    image: /images/untitled_artwork-2.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: yes
    desc: Experimental and abstract to showcaste one of my pieces that I created as
      I learned to identify, embrace and love my queerness. Being queer is
      unmatching, intuitive, abstract, undefined, outside the binary. Queerness
      is a gift from the Universe, which defies the categorization of a human
      soul. Alas, I learned that it is not a crime nor a sin to embody that
      which is Queer.

  - title: Dissonant Love // procreate digital piece (2023)
    image: /images/untitled_artwork-1.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: no
    desc: As I took the time to heal from an abusive relationship, I returned to my
      love for art and captured layers of dissonance yet beauty. Using my
      intuition, Dissonant Love captures the emotions I had felt while piecing
      myself together. While there is dissonance in this world, love is always a
      choice.

    image: /images/untitled_artwork.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: yes
    desc: Another experimental, intuitive and abstract piece created to express
      dissonance in this world. Nothing is aligned to the earth so long as she
      is not loved and respected. Instead, society is entirely constructed to
      misalign the body, mind, and soul.

    image: /images/2023-12-04-13.51.17.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: no
    desc: Following a car accident, and being gaslight about the cause of the
      incident-- this piece was born. I used my intuition and sense of play to
      express the pain of being lied to by someone I considered a close friend
      of mine. I often have wondered, how many times must I allow the treatment
      of narcissists to affect my soul especially because it's all I've ever
      known. This piece reminds me of the pain that I endured as raw and
      abstract as I could have ever expressed myself.

    title: Ladine Child
    desc: I was once a trans child who did not know who they were. At the time, I
      could not recognize my face, nor my voice. If I could go back, or offer
      future generations, I would not assign myself or any child a gender until
      they themselves are able to identify their own gender.

    title: Frozen Pieces // prisma colored pencil on paper (2013)
    desc: This still life piece was made when I was in middle school. Joining art
      club, I owe this creation to the support and belief in my talent from
      Kathleen Byrnes. This piece perfectly showcastes light on trinkets that I
      held close to my heart. In other terms, it also captures my fawn/freeze
      response that I had developed throughout childhood. Perfectly frozen, if
      only to show aesthetic light when in danger of predators throughout my
      life.

    title: Indigenous Pain //  acrylic on paper (2016)
    desc: "There is no singular way to describe the pain that indigenous people have
      to experience in today's late-stage capitalism. This piece was created
      when Trump was elected president, a figure who ceases to recognize the
      humanity of indigenous peoples of the U.S. and their intimate connection
      to the earth and her resources. "

    title: a Once Void Now a Colorful Oasis // acrylic on canvas (2022)
    desc: Queer friendship has saved my soul. For years I had gone through life with
      a void in my heart, and never understanding why. After rushing into
      university, attempting to fit in and conform with society- the last thing
      I would have expected to end the profound emptiness that my body possessed
      would be the loving recognition of my authentic identity. Queer love and
      recognition brought to me the life force that has been under persecution
      for many decades. To Bunnii, I owe this unprecedented moment of blissful
      healing which begs me to always center my queerness first before others.
      Thank you eternally <3

    title: Childhood Trinkets // prisma colored pencil on paper (2012)
    desc: "This still life piece was the beginning of my colored pencil journey on
      art portfolios. It begs for better perspective yet still embodies the
      child like expression that I will always possess. Still. Frozen. and
      endearing. This is how I survived my childhood, if only to impress and try
      to be useful. "

    title: Seth's Resonance // acrylic paint, posca marker, & fine pen (2022)
    desc: Exploring abstract and intuitive pieces, I'd find myself loving the
      process of resonant expression.  Making simple pieces has been an
      alleviation to my past pieces in which I had strived for perfect, detailed
      fine art pieces. To simplify and declutter the art process is a privilege
      that I honor in my practice to this day.

    title: Venus as a Boy Moth // prisma colored pencil on brown paper (2023)
    desc: Perhaps the most confusing part of identifying my true identity as a trans
      masculine person, has been accepting that I am at heart feminine.
      Following the hardest battle of updating my name and gender marker on all
      my name documents and license and seeing it all match with my authentic
      self has brought me a beautiful euphoria that resembles this moth. I am
      feminine, but I am a man- I am queer but I am also within the binary.
      While I have never seen anyone like me before, I embrace myself with pride
      knowing that I set a precedent for others to know that it is possible to
      shine fully as the beautiful person that they are.

    title: Save yourself first <3 // acrylic on canvas (2021)
    desc: "Having dedicated 2 1/2 years to my ex and our then relationship, I
      finally gave in to me and realizing that I would be the only person who
      could save my inner child. It was not possible for me to continue
      depending on someone to achieve happines, yet putting myself first had
      always felt wrong, difficult and meaningless. Nevertheless, I persisted to
      find out who I truly was: not cis-gender, and not just heterosexual."

      are neo-pronouns/identities that are just as valid as my own identity. "
