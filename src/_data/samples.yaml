  - title: Queer Power // procreate (2023)
    image: /images/untitled_artwork-2.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: yes
    desc: Experimental and abstract to showcaste one of my pieces that I created as
      I learned to identify, embrace and love my queerness. Being queer is
      unmatching, intuitive, abstract, undefined, outside the binary. Queerness
      is a gift from the Universe, which defies the categorization of a human
      soul. Alas, I learned that it is not a crime nor a sin to embody that
      which is Queer.

  - title: Dissonant Love // procreate digital piece (2023)
    image: /images/untitled_artwork-1.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: no
    desc: As I took the time to heal from an abusive relationship, I returned to my
      love for art and captured layers of dissonance yet beauty. Using my
      intuition, Dissonant Love captures the emotions I had felt while piecing
      myself together. While there is dissonance in this world, love is always a
      choice.

    image: /images/untitled_artwork.jpg
    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: yes
    desc: Another experimental, intuitive and abstract piece created to express
      dissonance in this world. Nothing is aligned to the earth so long as she
      is not loved and respected. Instead, society is entirely constructed to
      misalign the body, mind, and soul.

    audio: /audio/rain-and-thunder-nature-sounds-min.mp3
    highlight: no
    desc: Following a car accident, and being gaslight about the cause of the
      incident-- this piece was born. I used my intuition and sense of play to
      express the pain of being lied to by someone I considered a close friend
      of mine. I often have wondered, how many times must I allow the treatment
      of narcissists to affect my soul especially because it's all I've ever
      known. This piece reminds me of the pain that I endured as raw and
      abstract as I could have ever expressed myself.

    title: Ladine Child
    desc: I was once a trans child who did not know who they were. At the time, I
      could not recognize my face, nor my voice. If I could go back, or offer
      future generations, I would not assign myself or any child a gender until
      they themselves are able to identify their own gender.

    title: Frozen Pieces // prisma colored pencil on paper (2013)
    desc: This still life piece was made when I was in middle school. Joining art
      club, I owe this creation to the support and belief in my talent from
      Kathleen Byrnes. This piece perfectly showcastes light on trinkets that I
      held close to my heart. In other terms, it also captures my fawn/freeze
      response that I had developed throughout childhood. Perfectly frozen, if
      only to show aesthetic light when in danger of predators throughout my
      life.

    title: Indigenous Pain //  acrylic on paper (2016)
    desc: "There is no singular way to describe the pain that indigenous people have
      to experience in today's late-stage capitalism. This piece was created
      when Trump was elected president, a figure who ceases to recognize the
      humanity of indigenous peoples of the U.S. and their intimate connection
      to the earth and her resources. "

    title: a Once Void Now a Colorful Oasis // acrylic on canvas (2022)
    desc: Queer friendship has saved my soul. For years I had gone through life with
      a void in my heart, and never understanding why. After rushing into
      university, attempting to fit in and conform with society- the last thing
      I would have expected to end the profound emptiness that my body possessed
      would be the loving recognition of my authentic identity. Queer love and
      recognition brought to me the life force that has been under persecution
      for many decades. To Bunnii, I owe this unprecedented moment of blissful
      healing which begs me to always center my queerness first before others.
      Thank you eternally <3
